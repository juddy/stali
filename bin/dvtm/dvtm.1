.SS Mouse commands
.TP
.B Copy and Paste
By default dvtm captures mouse events to provide the actions listed below.
Unfortunately this interferes with the standard X copy and paste mechanism.
To work around this you need to hold down
.B Shift
while selecting or pasting text.
Alternatively you can disable mouse support at compile time, start dvtm with the
.B -M
flag or toggle mouse support during runtime with
.BR Mod\-M .
.TP
.B Button1 click
Focus window.
.TP
.B Button1 double click
Focus window and toggle maximization.
.TP
.B Button2 click
Zoom/cycle current window to/from master area.
.TP
.B Button3 click
Toggle minimization of current window.
.SS Copy mode
Copy mode gives easy access to past output by piping it to an editor. What
ever the editor prints to stdout upon exiting will be stored in an internal
register and can be pasted into other clients (via
.B Mod\-p
)
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B DVTM
Each process spawned by dvtm will have this variable set to the dvtm version
it is running under.
.TP
.B DVTM_WINDOW_ID
Each process also has access to its constant and unique window id.
.TP
.B DVTM_CMD_FIFO
If the -c command line argument was specified upon dvtm startup, this variable
will be set to the file name of the named pipe. Thus allowing the process
to send commands back to dvtm.
.TP
.B DVTM_TERM
By default dvtm uses its own terminfo file and therefore sets
.BR TERM=dvtm
within the client windows. This can be overridden by setting the
.BR DVTM_TERM
environment variable to a valid terminal name before launching dvtm.
.TP
.B DVTM_EDITOR
When entering the copymode dvtm pipes the whole scroll back buffer to
.BR DVTM_EDITOR
which is launched with
.BR \-
(indicating to read from stdin) as its only argument.
If
.BR DVTM_EDITOR
is not set
.BR EDITOR
is checked, if this is also not set the default value specified in
.BR config.h
is used instead.
.SH EXAMPLE
See the
.I dvtm-status
script as an example of how to display text in the
status bar.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dvtm is customized by creating a custom
.I config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
