What is it?
===========

smdev is a simple program to manage device nodes.  It is
mostly compatible with mdev but doesn't have all of its features.

Building
========

You need to have the kernel headers available on your
system to build smdev.

To build a statically linked smdev against musl-libc[0]
install the relevant cross-compiler[1], then install the kernel
headers into your cross-compiler prefix and finally run
the following:

$ make CC=x86_64-musl-linux-gcc LDFLAGS=-static
$ x86_64-linux-musl-strip smdev

On my system the above results in a 88kB statically linked
application.
