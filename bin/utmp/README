utmp is a small program which update the utmp record of the current tty.
It is designed for helping in some terminal emulators or session manager
which lack support for it.

Compile:
-------

There  are  three  different interfaces to utmp: SystemV, BSD and POSIX.
SystemV and POSIX are basically the same  interfaces (POSIX  has  better
definitons for utmp fields, like for example ut_pid which in some system
was a short instead of a pid_t), but BSD is very different. utmp has im‚Äê
plemented  the  three interfaces  and it supplies three different config
files, so the user only has to rename the proper one to config.mk. It is
also  added a basic configure, which selects the POSIX interface for all
platforms except for OpenBSD.


 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install
