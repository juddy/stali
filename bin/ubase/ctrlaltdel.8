.Nd set the function of Ctrl-Alt-Del combination
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Based on examination of the
.Pa linux/kernel/sys.c
code, it is clear that there
are two supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence can perform: a
hard reset, which immediately reboots the computer without calling
.Xr sync 2
and without any other preparation; and a soft reset, which sends the
SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the init process (this is always the process
with PID 1). If this option is used, the
.Xr init 8
program must support this feature.
